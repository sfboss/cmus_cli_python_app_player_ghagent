## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Async Architecture**: Built on asyncio for efficient I/O operations
2. **Rich Library**: For beautiful terminal UI rendering
3. **SQLite**: Lightweight database for library management
4. **TOML**: Human-friendly configuration format
5. **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom features
6. **Event-Driven**: Reactive updates via event bus

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core components
- Mock CMUS interface for isolated testing
- Async test support
- Coverage reporting

## Future Enhancements

While the core application is complete, these features from the specification could be added:

- **Advanced UI**: Full TUI with keyboard navigation
- **Visualization**: Spectrum analyzer, waveforms
- **Lyrics**: Integration with lyrics providers
- **Scrobbling**: Last.fm, ListenBrainz support
- **Statistics**: Listening analytics
- **Themes**: Custom color schemes
- **Advanced Features**: A-B repeat, smart playlists, recommendations
